## Blitz

A simple presentation app that enforces a specific format: 

* 20 slides
* 15 seconds each
* 5 minutes total

Requires Mac OS X 10.5/Intel (it's `x86_64`-only).

## TODO

MUST

- Full-screen display.

- Escape key to exit full-screen mode.

SHOULD

- Better end-of-talk display.

- Turn progress meter into "play" button upon document load.

- Disable scroll wheel.

- Modify progress meter from digital (update once/second) to analog (continuous, perhaps 24 fps).

NICE

- Utilize QuickLook so we can consume `.key` files directly (asking QL to give us the PDF representation transparently).

- Don't hard-code display to 1280x720 (16:9).

- Allow choice of main presentation display.
