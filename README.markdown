# Blitz

A simple presentation app that enforces a specific format: 

* 20 slides
* 15 seconds each
* 5 minutes total

To use, drop a PDF file onto its icon. Blitz assumes you'll have 20 slides at 1280x720. It will start the presentation immediately, automatically advancing to the next slide every 15 seconds.

Requires Mac OS X 10.5/Intel (it's `x86_64`-only).
